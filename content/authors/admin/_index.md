I am an assistant professor in Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Old Dominion University, US, in 2023, advised by [Dr. Hongyi Wu](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~mhwu/), and B.S. degree in Computer Science from Hunan University, China, in 2017. 
My research interests in the intersection of cybersecurity and AI. On the one hand, investigate using machine learning/deep learning to solve security problem in computer system or cyber-physical system; on the other hand, investigate the robustness and safety of the AI systems(such as Computer Vision, Vision-Language Multi-Modal models), including adversarial attack and backdoor attack.
